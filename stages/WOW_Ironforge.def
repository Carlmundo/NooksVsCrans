; Definition of stage 0 (training stage)
; *** denotes values you should change/check for each stage.
; The term "background" is used to mean both backgrounds and foregrounds.

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Info]
 ;Name of the stage.
name = "WOW_Ironforge"

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Camera]
 ;Camera starting position: Usually 0 for both
startx = 0
starty = 0

 ;Left and right bound of camera
 ;You may want to fiddle a bit with these values to make sure the
 ;background doesn't move too far or too little
 ;***
boundleft = -120
boundright = 110

 ;High and low bound of camera
 ;High is a negative number. Make is more negative if you want to
 ;camera to be able to move higher.
 ;Low should usually be 0.
 ;If omitted, defaults to -25 and 0 respectively
 ;***
boundhigh = -0
boundlow = 0

 ;This is how much the camera will move vertically towards the
 ;highest player. Valid values are from 0 to 1. A value of 0 will mean
 ;the camera does not move up at all. A value of 1 will makes the camera
 ;follow the highest player.
 ;Typically .2 for normal-sized backgrounds. You may need to pull this
 ;value up for taller backgrounds.
verticalfollow = .4

 ;Minimum vertical distance the highest player has to be from the floor,
 ;before the camera starts to move up to follow him. For extremely
 ;tall stages, a floor tension of about 20-30 coupled with a
 ;vertical-follow of .8 allows the camera to follow the action.
floortension = 0

 ;Horizontal distance player is from edge before camera starts to move
 ;left or right. Typically 50 or 60.
tension = 40


;--------------------------------------------------------
[PlayerInfo]
;--- Player 1 ---
 ;Player 1 starting coordinates.
 ;p1startx is typically -70 and p2startx is 70.
 ;p1starty and p1startz should be 0.
p1startx = -70          ;Starting x coordinates
p1starty = 0            ;Starting y coordinates
p1startz = 0            ;Starting z coordinates
p1facing = 1            ;Direction player faces: 1=right, -1=left

;--- Player 2 ---
p2startx = 70
p2starty = 0
p2startz = 0
p2facing = -1

;--- Common ---
 ;Don't change these values.
leftbound  = -1000 ;Left bound (x-movement)
rightbound =  1000 ;Right bound
topbound  =  0     ;Top bound (z-movement)
botbound  =  0     ;Bottom bound

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Scaling]
 ;No need to change these values
topz     = 0       ;Top z-coordinate for scaling
botz     = 50      ;Bottom z-coordinate for scaling
topscale = 1       ;Scale to use at top
botscale = 1.2     ;Scale to use at bottom

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Bound]
 ;Distance from left/right edge of screen that player can move to
 ;Typically 15
screenleft = 15   ;Dist from left of screen that player can move to
screenright = 15 ;Right edge

;--------------------------------------------------------
[StageInfo]
 ;Z offset for drawing
 ;Adjust this value to move the ground level up/down in the screen.
 ;It's the position where the players stand at.
 ;Up - smaller, Down - larger
 ;***
zoffset = 220

 ;Leave this at 1. It makes the players face each other
autoturn = 1

 ;Set the following to 1 to have the background be reset between
 ;rounds.
resetBG = 1

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Shadow]
 ;This is the shadow darkening intensity. Valid values range from
 ;0 (lightest) to 256 (darkest). Defaults to 128 if omitted.
intensity = 128
 ;This is the shadow color given in r,g,b. Valid values for each
 ;range from 0 (lightest) to 255 (darkest).
 ;Defaults to 0,0,0 if omitted.
 ;intensity and color's effects add up to give the final shadow
 ;result.
color = 0,0,0

 ;This is the scale factor of the shadow. Use a big scale factor
 ;to make the shadow longer. You can use a NEGATIVE scale factor
 ;to make the shadow fall INTO the screen.
 ;Defaults to 0.4 if omitted.
yscale = .3

 ;This parameter lets you set the range over which the shadow is
 ;visible. The first value is the high level, and the second is
 ;the middle level. Both represent y-coordinates of the player.
 ;A shadow is invisible if the player is above the high level,
 ;and fully visible if below the middle level. The shadow is
 ;faded in between the two levels. This gives an effect of the
 ;shadow fading away as the player gets farther away from the
 ;ground. If omitted, defaults to no level effects (shadow is
 ;always fully visible).
fade.range = 0,0

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Reflection]
 ;Intensity of reflection (from 0 to 256). Set to 0 to have no
 ;reflection. Defaults to 0.
intensity = 0

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Music]
 ;Put a filename for a MOD, MP3 or MIDI here, or just leave it
 ;blank if you don't want music. If an invalid filename is
 ;given, then no music will play. To play CD audio, put
 ;the track number followed by ".da". Using a track number of
 ;0 will play a random audio track. For example, to play
 ;track 3 from a music CD, use:
 ;  bgmusic = 3.da
bgmusic = sound/ironforge.mp3

 ;Adjust the volume. 0 is normal, negative for softer, and
 ;positive for louder (only for mp3, mods and CDA)
bgvolume = 455

; Main background definition
[BGdef]
 ;Filename of sprite data
spr = WOW_Ironforge.sff

 ;Set to 1 if you want to clear the screen to magenta before
 ;drawing layer 0 (the default background). Good for spotting "holes"
 ;in your background.
 ;Remember to turn this off when you are done debugging the background,
 ;because it slows down performance.
debugbg = 0


;----------
; Start each background element with the following:
; Make sure it's "[BG n]", where n is anything you like (it's only used to
; report errors.) For example, you could use:  [BG TheFloor]
; Specify as many as you like. This is an example of a normal background:
;[BG 0]

 ;The background type goes here: for now, only NORMAL and PARALLAX
 ;If this line is omitted, the type will be assumed to be normal.
;type  = normal

 ;The sprite number to use for the background (from the SFF specified above)
 ;It's the group-number, followed by a comma, then the sprite-number
 ;*** Do not omit this line.
;spriteno = 0, 0

 ;This is the layer number, which determines where the sprite is drawn to.
 ;Valid values are 0 and 1.
 ;0 for background (behind characters), 1 for foreground (in front)
 ;If this line is omitted, the default value of 0 will be assumed.
;layerno = 0                

 ;This is the starting location of the background in the format
 ;x, y
 ;If this line is omitted, the default value of 0,0 will be assumed.
;start = 0, 0

 ;These are the number of pixels the background moves for every single unit
 ;of camera movement, in the format
 ;x, y
 ;For the main background (eg. the floor the players stand on) you'll want
 ;to use a delta of 1,1. Things farther away should have a smaller delta,
 ;like 0.5 for example. Things near the camera should have a larget delta.
 ;If this line is omitted, the default value of 1,1 will be assumed.
;delta = 1, 1

 ;Here is the transparency setting of the background.
 ;Valid values are:
 ;"none" for normal drawing
 ;"add" for colour addition (like a spotlight effect)
 ;"add1" for colour addition with background dimmed to 50% brightness
 ;"sub" for colour subtraction (like a shadow effect)
 ;If this line is omitted, it's assumed that there will be no transparency.
;trans = none

 ;Mask means whether or not to draw colour zero of a sprite.
 ;If you turn masking off, the background will take less CPU power to draw,
 ;so remember to turn it off on sprites that don't use it.
 ;If this line is omitted, it's assumed that there will be no masking.
;mask  = 0

 ;The format for tiling is x,y. For each of them, the value is:
 ;0 to use no tiling, 1 to tile, n where (n>1) to tile n times.
 ;If this line is omitted, it's assumed that there will be no tiling.
;tile  = 1, 0

 ;This is the x and y space between each tile, for tiled backgrounds
 ;If omitted, default value is 0,0
;tilespacing = 0,0

 ;This defines the drawing space, or "window" of the background. It's
 ;given in the form
 ;x1,y1, x2,y2
 ;where (x1,y1)-(x2,y2) define a rectangular box.
 ;Make the window smaller if you only want to draw part of the background.
 ;You normally do not have to change this setting. Value values range from
 ;0-319 for x, and 0-239 for y. The values are 0,0, 319,239 by default (full
 ;screen).
