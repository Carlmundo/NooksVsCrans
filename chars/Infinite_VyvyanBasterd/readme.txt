Vyvyan Basterd is a psychopathic punk metal medical student. Described as a "Ruthless and sadistic maniac" by Rick,
he regularly attacks both Rick and Neil with pieces of wood, cricket bats and other objects such as frying pans, hammers and keetles.
The only person who is safe from his extreme violence and cruelty is Mike whom he greatly respects, looks up to and tries to impress.
He is played by Adrian Edmondson. Inspired by Infinite's SVK Ryu and Ken and his other SVK Edits
