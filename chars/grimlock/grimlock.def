; Spring Quarter 2001 - Individual Learning Contract:
; Video Game Character Creation
;-------------------------------
; This quarter in my studies of 3-D graphics, I created this MUGEN character.
; I created all of the sprites myself using a 3-D model I made in
; "3D Studio Max".  The 3D model was based on a Transformer toy called
; "Grimlock", which transformed from a robot to a T-Rex.
; (and back).
;===========================================
; Play controls
;---------------
; 
;   MUGEN's controls are configurable from within the game via the "Options"
; menu item in the main menu.  The button layout here refers to my own
; controller, a Sidewinder gamepad.  See MUGEN's controller settings to see
; how your controller (or keyboard) is configured.
;
; Fwd. & Back:  Moves the character forwards & backwards
;               (when facing right, right = forwards)
; Up:           Jump up (hold up+[left or right] to jump diagonally)
; Down:         Crouch
; Back:         Guard while character is attacking
; Down + Back:  Guard while crouching
; Fwd., Fwd.:   Run forwards
; Back, Back:   Hop backwards
; X Button:     Light Punch
; Y Button:     Hard Punch
; A Button:     Light Kick (hold fwd. to move forward while attacking)
; B Button:     Hard Kick
; (Punches and Kicks can be used while standing, crouching, or jumping)
; C Button or Start: Random Taunt
;  Taunt Selection-------------------
;    Hold the indicated direction while pressing C or Start to select a taunt:
;       Down: "Me Grimlock want to munch metal!"
;       Back: "Me bash brains!"
;       Fwd:  "Me king!"
;    The longer the speech lasts, the more power you will gain.
;
;------Unique Moves-------------
; Down + Forward + Y:  Crouching Uppercut Launcher
;
; Victory Speech selection----------------------
;  After you win a match, press and hold a button to pick a speech:
;   X or A button: "Me Grimlock kick butt!!"
;   Y or B button: "Me Grimlock love challenge."
;   Z or C button: "Me Grimlock no like you."
