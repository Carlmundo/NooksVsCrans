1/ What's this and what's needed?
   ------------------------------

  This is the 5th character I made for MUGEN!! His name: Flynn Peter Taggart... He is
from the wonderfull DOOM serie, and DOOM is one of my favorite game...
  I added some items... See yourself!!
  Well, to play with this character, you will need firstly the game itself (MUGEN)
you can download it at http://mugen.elecbyte.com... Make sure that all files are
here:

- flynn.def (Main file)
- fly.sff      (Graphics)
- fly.snd      (Sounds)
- fly.cmd      (Command file)
- fly.cns      (States)

- indigo.act     (2nd palette)
- red.act    (3rd palette)
- brown.act   (4th palette)

  To install it, unzip all those files in a directory called flynn in the
"chars\" directory then edit the "select.cfg" in the data/ directory and
under the [characters] section write "flynn," and play...
