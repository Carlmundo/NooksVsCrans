--- Notes ---
Mike can move freely around the ring.  Your goal is to either knock out your opponent if you are playing as Mike, or jump up and hit him above the waist if you're fighting against him.  Keep in mind that he cannot be hit by throws or projectiles.  And like in Punch Out, the uppercut kills in one hit.  He will flash while using it.  Be careful!  Also keep in mind that the Ring background may hide your lifebars.  You will need to go into your fight.def file and set the layerno = 2 of all of your attributes.
