Ahem, welcome to nintendo switch's readme! Where you will see
specials, hypers, even scrapped projects, versions and credits!

Now, enjoy reading and finding out the specials and hypers control!

-------[Moveset]-------

------------(Power Charge)-------------
Power charge can be used by holding a+start. Can't be used if the power is full.
---------[Taunt]----------------
To do a normal taunt, press start.
To do a fake FIRE! taunt, press foward, then start.
---------------[Combo]------------
Unfortunately, there's only one combo. But hey, I don't
feel like making nintendo switch a combo character, right?

To perform switch's combo, if you're near the opponent, press
X, then Y, then press Z and the combo is done.
That's it, the combo is pretty much done.

------------[Update]-------------
Whoopsie, I forgot to update the update. Meh, kinda too lazy but i'll do it anyways.
V.13:
4 new palettes! Some of them are pretty genius, thanks to tommy attacks.
Nintendo switch realistically hovers. Now i'm not sure but i think this is thanks to AltoidDealer for the jailbot hover, maybe i guess... Also thanks to tommy attacks for putting it in. This was also an originally cancelled thing, but it was brought back.
All of the super/special moves were given more traditional inputs (like quarter circle forward, quarter circle backward, etc.) soo that it will be easier to do. (or at least remember, also thanks to tommy attacks for that.)
Updated the MBAA protrait with derpy's MBAA protrait.
Changed the jump sound to a more modern one, like let's say super smash bros 4 mario jump- WAIT SMASH ISN'T IN THE SWITCH! I'M TRIGGERED
Added hitsparks when nintendo switch punches while using a grab move.
A new hyper! Garbage Puyos and Blocks!
V.12:
Cappy throw is now changed and improved, thanks to oliver.
The 'cap'ture hyper hat is also improved by oliver too!
The controller craziness now uses random x velocities, thanks to oliver.
Animaton edit on rocket controller, thanks to oliver.
V.11.5:
Fixed the 'Cap'ture bug where the opponent can't attack.
Added a MBAA protrait.
V.11:
Removed white lines on nintendo switch big icon.
Added the hyper that was once cancelled: 'Cap'ture!
Added the rune in assist link that was once cancelled: Stasis!
The phantom ruby was improved, thanks to oliver.
The 5000/5070's positions were fixed, thanks to oliver.
The switch click intro is longer a bit.
New hyper is added! Called Giant Console.
Made the finisher a bit short.
Spring man was buffed.
Link's magnesis was buffed.
Mario was buffed a little.
The controller throw now makes it randomly throw
red controller or blue controller!
The nintendo switch's assists now turn around when
attacking.
Made the click intro always happening when fighting
kung fu rosen.
Made it so assists don't give the player power
when attacking the opponent.
Electricity Sphere was buffed a bit.

V.10: Where the character starts.
------------[Update]-------------
  
------------[Scrapped Projects]-------------
Nintendo Switch was gonna have no and yes animations on continue
screen but that was cancelled because I found out that it didn't
work.

The hammer smash would make the opponent dizzy but it was
removed.

The garbage puyos and blocks were supposed to aim on the oppnent, making the opponent getting hit all the time 
but it was removed due it's overpowered.

I was planning to give the light blue screen that covers all of the screen but it's transparent in final smash, but it didn't go so well, so it's scrapped.
