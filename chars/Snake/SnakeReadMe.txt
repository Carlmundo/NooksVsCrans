SOLID SNAKE v2.0 by SeanAltly
For Mugen 1.0 ONLY!
This ReadME written on May 30th, 2011

****************************
VERSION UPDATE INFO

Here is a list of what has been updated in this version:

-Sprites updated to my current style, with better shading, some smoother anims, and more color depth. For example, the two main colors of his sneaking suit (the darker gray and the lighter gray) are now 5 shades each rather than 3 each like they were before.
-All new AI by Kamekaze which use's 1.0's AI Level feature, like my other recent characters. Of course, that means it's 1.0 only until someone makes a patch.
-Removed his Solid Barrage super move, so it would differentiate him more from The Specialist, and because it both wasn't his style and he didn't really need it. Even without it he still has 5 supers (High Famas, Low Famas, C4 Grab, Stinger Missile, and Genome Soldiers).
-Added new hi-res explosion FX for his grenades and Stinger (FX are credit to Ryon).
-Added envshake to his specials, supers and throws so they have more visual impact.
-Replaced forward hop with a Run (using all new sprites). Greatly improves his rushdown game, especially useful after hitting with the Stun Grenade.
-Speaking of the Stun Grenade, I reduced the clsn area so it's not a full screen attack, but gave Snake the ability to roll it at 3 different speeds, which effects where the explosion occurs, meaning he can use it as a zoning move.
-Changed many of his commands. Check the ReadMe for specifics, but the biggest changes are that he doesn't use charge commands for his SOCOM anymore, and his Claymore is now D,D,P rather than D,DB,B,P (I needed to free up that command for the new SOCOM commands).
-Added an assertspecial that stops music during Codec win poses so you can hear the dialogue better.
-Made him slightly faster and much more combo friendly.
-Tons of little code fixes here and there (since I've learned a lot about proper code and game mechanics since I first created him), including flagging recovery frames, adjusted hitvels, hittimes, recovery times, etc., all of which work to make him more balanced, efficient, and hopefully not broken. Kamekaze also made his clsns more balanced.
-All Socom shots do less damage but have less startup/recovery
-A TON of minor and major coding tweaks
-New aesthetic updates, such as dust when jumping, new jump sounds, etc.
-Just generally a massive update that makes him better in every way


****************************

ORIGIN: Well, if you're downloading this character, you probably already know all about Solid Snake. Just in case you don't, Snake is a former member of the FOXHOUND unit and the star of the Metal Gear Solid games. He is a middle-aged, grisled combat veteran and an expert at sneaking missions and stealth in general. This incarnation of him is from the original Metal Gear Solid on the Playstation 1. He sports his sneaking suit from that game and is aided by Colonel Roy Campbell (as well as Otacon) over the Codec.

****************************

GAMEPLAY: Snake uses the "dial-a-combo" or "chain combo" system, much like that used in MvC and Darkstalkers. This means that any of his standard attacks can be chained in order of strength, from weakest to strongest, thus any sequence of Light, Medium, and Heavy attacks will chain into a multi-hit combo (LP-MP-HK for example, which is essentially his three-hit combo from MGS). His crouching HP acts as a launcher for air-combos. His special moves consist of weapon based attacks for the most part and are quite damaging, but have a decent amount of start-up for balance. His super moves are Level based, which you will see below.

Snake is designed so that it is easy to use him defensively or offensively, though I'd be lying if I said his style doesn't lend more to defensive gameplay (though this may have changed with the speed change).

****************************

Special Moves:

*Socom Pistol (D,DB,B,P)- Three varieties, depending on strength of button pressed.
     -Silenced (LP) - The weakest due to the suppressor, but also has the least start-up.
     -Unsuppressed Shot (MP) - In the middle for start-up and damage.
     -Two Unsuppressed Shots (HP) - Self explanatory.

*Low Socom Pistol (D,DB,B,K)- Three varieties, depending on strength of button pressed.
     -Silenced (LK) - The weakest due to the suppressor, but also has the least start-up.
     -Unsuppressed Shot (MK) - In the middle for start-up and damage.
     -Two Unsuppressed Shots (HK) - Self explanatory.

*Claymore Mine (D,D,P) - Snake sets a claymore mine down. He can be damaged by it as well, so don't forget that you set it down! Disappears after roughly 10-12 seconds for balance, however, you can set up to 3 at a time.

*Stealth Camouflage (D,DF,F,Start) - Snake activated his stealth camo. Lasts around 6-7 seconds. Useless against CPU opponents, but fun against Human opponents.

*Evasive Roll (F+LP+LK) or (B+LP+LK) - Snake rolls, passing through opponents, attacks, and projectiles, but not Super Combos or Throws. The command used causes Snake to roll forward or away, respectively. Also, Snake can perform some of his basic moves right out of the last few frames of animation (when he's standing up from the roll).

*Hand Grenade (D,DF,F,P) - Three variations. All grenades can hit downed enemies.
     -High-Arch (HP) - A high-arching, long distance throw, with lengthy hang time. Must be blocked high.
     -Forward Pitch (MP) - Snake throws the grenade more or less straight towards the enemy.
     -Roll (LP) - Snake rolls the grenade along the ground. Must be blocked low.

*Stun Grenade (D,DF,F,K) - Snake rolls a stun grenade across the ground. The stun will only connect with opponents who are on the ground and it can be blocked. If it connects however, the opponent will be stunned and completely vulnerable for 2-3 seconds. If it doesn't connect, Snake will be unable to throw another Stun Grenade for a couple of seconds (this is a balancing measure).

****************************

Throws:

*Overhead Toss (HP+HK or F+HP+HK) - Snake's standard throw. Press foward to throw them in the opposite direction.

*Choke Hold - (B+HP) - Snake applies a choke hold before kicking his opponent away. Longer range than a normal grab, but more start-up/recovery.

****************************

Super Moves:

Level 1

*FAMAS (D,DF,F,D,DF,F,P) - Snake fires his FAMAS assault rifle.

*FAMAS Low (D,DF,F,D,DF,F,K) - Snake crouches before firing his FAMAS assault rifle.

Level 2

*C-4 (D,DB,B,D,DB,B,K) - Snake slams his opponent on the ground, plants some C-4 on their body, then distances himself before detonating it, sending his opponent high into the air.

Level 3

*Stinger Missile (D,DB,B,D,DB,B,P) - Snake fires a Stinger Missile at his opponent. As mentioned before, it has no homing capabilities. Sorry guys. I did make the explosion bigger though!

*Genome Army (D,DF,F,DF,D,DB,B,K) - Snake hides in a cardboard box while a confused group of Genome soldiers fire a cannonade of FAMAS rounds at the opponent.

****************************
