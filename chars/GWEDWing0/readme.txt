Controls
========

Basic Controls
--------------

Wing Zero is a 4-button character. Button X is his weak
unarmed attack, button Y his strong unarmed attack, 
A for weak weapon attack, and B for his strong weapon attack. 
We will use W. to mean weak, and S.for strong. When you see
a target on p2, you can use your gatling gun with either 
X or Y, but only on the ground. The recovery of the gatling
can be boost, special or hyper canceled. YES IM AWARE HE GETS
POWER BACK, THAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

We will use the notation:
D - down
F - forward
U - up
B - back
x - button X 
y - button Y 
z - boost short cut
a - button A 
b - button B 
c - boost short cut
OTG - this attack hits on the ground as well

-----------------

U              - Jump
UF             - Jump forwards
F              - Walk forwards

B, B           - Back dash
xy             - Recovery (when falling)


Boosting System
---------------
Pressing any 2 attack buttons will make the Gundam boost
corresponding on when and how its done. While standing
you can boost forward or backward with auto guard property.
However, unlike typical autoguard it will just make you
block immediately. This is used to gain in closer. If you
boost while not holding a direction or in the air you will
perform a super jump in which you can air dash forward or
backward by pressing a direction and two attack buttons. 
You can also just boost upwards again. However there is a
certain ammount of time that has to pass for you to perform
an attack so be cautious. Only supers can be done at any time
during a boost.

You can also boost cancel out of all normals and the recovery
of certain supers.

Standing Boost - F+2 button
Back Dash Boost- B+2 button
Air boost - 2 buttons stand alone
Air Dash foward - during Air boost F+2 Buttons

Combo notes
===========

The Gundam's strengths lie in his ability to chain moves into each
other. Here are his basic combo rules:

1.  You can combo from weaker basic attacks into stronger ones
    eg. X-> A-> B
    eg. X->A->Y 

2.  You can combo into special attacks from most basic attacks
    eg. X -> Shield upper

3.  You can combo into hyper attacks from all basic and special
    attacks


These rules make it possible for you to do some damaging combos.
Experiment, and perfect your own combos!

Recovery Cancel notes
=====================

During the recovery of certain moves you can cancel into a special or hyper.
You can also cancel weaker gattling. All normals can be boost cancelled or hyper
cancelled on recovery frames.



1.  X Gattling -> Y Gattling

2.  Gattling -> Buster shot

3.  Buster shot -> Buster Beam
