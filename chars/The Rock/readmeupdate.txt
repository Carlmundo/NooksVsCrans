remove the ddt because you don't really need it.

just try please tell me if you like this version and this not like the rock in the wwf no mercy game this is a custom version.

credit's
MarianoRyu or  Ebilbryan for making the Rock's texture i really don't know who made him sorry if i got it wrong.
WWERULES507 for ripping  the 3d sprite's from wwf no mercy.
Zobbes for editing the rock
unkown creator for making The Rock because the creator  i don't really know this person's name.

The reason why i am making  character's like this  for mugen it's because in wwf no mercy you can't put his texture  in some game's that's one reason second because of the glitche's in the game.
