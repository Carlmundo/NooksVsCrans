-=[Intro]=-
In a beginning made as a joke release for April's Fools, later becomes a
more serious project for me. It's no mistery I'm a Scott Pilgrim fan, so
after made the first-beta-joke release, I promised to myself to make a
non-joke proper version of Scott for MUGEN. The reason I made the past
version is because there's almost no sprites of him apart of the gifs
Paul Robertson (character designer from SPvTW: The Game) released in his
blog, so I replaced with random 8-bit sprites for gethits and random
Scott sprites for the other basic moves.
But this time, I got the way to recreate them, so I become a spriter and
remade all the required sprites and a lot from his moves in the game to
adapt him as he deserves in MUGEN. And even with strikers, using mainly
the ones Robertson already released for other chars, and even I tried to
resprite recent Wallace sprites from the last DLC release.
Well, I expanded too much about him. I'm very proud of what I did with
Scott and I hope you enjoy him, made from a SP fan to MUGEN fans out
there. And who knows, maybe I could resprite another character from this
awesome game in a future ;)
