Master chief Moves set as of 3/17/08 (happy st. patricks day :])



Special attacks/How to fire a gun
D,Df,F [button] - thats pretty much how you fire any gun, although there's only 2 guns that are projectiles, and the sniper rifle should go all the way across the screen, depending on the stage
D,DB,B X - throws a grenade

And thats pretty much all the special attacks i think.. that first one pretty much sums it up :P

super attacks
D, DB, B, D, DB, B, x - (consumes 1 power gauge) fires the bazooka
D, DB, B, D, DB, B, y - (consumes 1 power guage) chief does a combination of beatdowns and firing
D, DF, F, D, DF, F, b - (consumes 2 power guages) Chief fires his laz0r
D, DB, B, D, DB, B, z - (consumes 2 power gauges) some unlikely hero help...(try it, for fun :D)
D, DF, F, D, DF, F, x - (consumes 3 power gauges) my favorite, still a bit glitchy, but its chiefs flamethrower :D



yep, this is a real short moves list .... but at least its somewhat of a complete char >_>
