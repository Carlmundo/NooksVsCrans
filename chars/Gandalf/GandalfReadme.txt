In a hole in the ground there lived a Hobbit...

**************************
Gandalf by Cpn Crossfader
**************************

This is an original work, coded and sprited by Cpn Crossfader May 2018.

This is a totally unoffical and unendorsed tribute inspired by Gandalf The Grey,
as portrayed by Sir Ian McKellen in LOTR/The Hobbit, including several references from the books/movies.

Moves- 
x/y/z staff attacks
a/b/c sword attacks

When you perform a sword attack, Gandalf must first draw it from his sheath. This causes a split second delay, unless the sword has
already been drawn in a previous attack, so it is possible to chain sword attacks together without needing to unsheath it. If you
stand idle for several seconds, he will re-sheath his sword. He also puts it away if you walk forwards or backwards, or duck/jump.

QCF + a/b/c = Petrify

This turns the opponent to stone for a couple of seconds.

QCF + x/y/z = Mind Control

This forces the opponent to turn around and walk away for a few seconds before the effect wares off

QCB + x/y/z = Grow

In this move, Gandalf grows in size, and uses the "Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks!" quote. All attacks powers are
increased, and he will stay this size until a move hits the opponent, then he returns to normal size and strength.


SUPERS (require 1 level to use)

QCB + a/b/c = Flaming sword

An original attack, he summons lightning to strike and channels the energy through a flaming sword swing

B, then F + x/y/z = YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

His strongest move, taken from the Fellowship of the Ring. He slams his staff down creating a powerful energy wave.


Other cult references-
He rides in on Shadowfax in the intro to round 1.
If he loses a round, he will return in the following rounds as Gandalf the White, with slightly increased attack powers.
His Taunt and Victory celebration is to smoke some Old Toby.

I may or may not add a Smaug firework special move at some point, like at Bilbo's leaving party.
