Final Boss Based on the Sonic 2 version, for Winmugen (may also work in DOS)
By supermystery

Version 1
==========
Yes! the final boss of Sonic 2

Orginal Sounds 

You can use this character, but its more fun if your fighting it

Although this character looks ok on most stages i recommend this on the actual Death Egg Zone custom stage i did, download that from the same place


Known Issues:
==================
This is not an accurate conversion 
* robotniks bombs are done differently
* due to the way the sprites where cleaned/ripped it wasnt possible to bind the jet as the character was walking/landing, doesnt really matter imo because rockets are meant to lift you off the ground anyway.

================================================================
Moves
=================================================================

March

a/b/c

Bomb

Jet Target Smasher (Press a/b/c just as eggman is launching off into the air for some bombs)
z

=====================================================================
Notes
=====================================================================
Please dont distribute this character to any one else, it took me a while to rip this character 
it also took me a long time to do the animations.

Please give me credit and notify if you use this character again for any of your creations.
