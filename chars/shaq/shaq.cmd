; method, and thus are optional.  But there remains a possibility that a
; future version of the helper method might be helped by having these
; commands placed here, and Anim 74140108 would then be used to indicate
; that a partner character has a compatible CMD.

; Note that if you make any changes to the basic one-button or recovery
; commands, you'll need to make the same changes to their matching commands here
; and/or in the XOR VarSet controller.  That includes things like, for example:
;  * changing the recovery command to use a different combination of buttons.
;  * renaming the b button command as "d", or the start button command as "s".
;  * switching the button names around, e.g. so button y triggers "a" and button a triggers "y".
;  * having more than one way to trigger the same command name.
; If you understand how the XOR method works, the proper changes should be obvious.
; If you don't understand it, then simply disable the lines in the XOR VarSet
; controller that correspond to the commands you've altered.

; Here add matching commands for any moves that must never be used randomly
; by the computer, such as suicide moves and super moves, and add the pairs
; to the XOR VarSet controller in State -3.

; If you're desperate to make sure that the AI always gets turned on as soon
; as possible, you can add more equivalents for your own commands here too,
; and add to the XOR VarSet controller's triggers accordingly.  You should
; use button-only commands before using any commands with directional
; components, as the latter apparently doesn't work in Linux Mugen 2002.04.14.

; And of course, if you've run out of unique command labels (Mugen allows
; 128), you can remove as many of these as you want.  You'll of course need
; to modify the XOR VarSet controller's triggers accordingly, but Mugen
; will let you know if you forget to do so. :)
