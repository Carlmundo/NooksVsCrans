Shaquille O'Neal from Shaq Fu 0.97 by The_None.

Biography and backstory that doesn't make any sense:

from Shaq Fu's original description, arranged a bit by me:
"A once dominating force on and off the hoops court, rookie of the year, perennial all star, a man of steel and the founder of Shaqido...an extremely lethal martial art form. Shaq, once rescuing Nezu and playing the charity game with a Beast, must redeem himself from the bad attitude give by his previous failure as an Enertainer."

Changelog:
2013 "holy shit when I was commenting on my code I realized I did plenty of mistakes here" version:

-Commented on the code
