ARTHAS IN MUGEN

Release 4+ Updates
-----------------------------------------------------
BUG FIXES:
- Fixed an issue with Plague Strike that caused the enemy to be "pulled" towards Arthas if the enemy's 
back was facing him.
- Plague Strike can now be blocked.
- Fixed an issue that caused Icy Touch to change into Plague Strike if Arthas was hit before his attack 
landed.
-----------------------------------------------------
IBM:
- Insane Boss Mode (IBM) is now here! This mode, available for AI only, is activated when you "kill" Arthas 
in Normal Mode. Not only will you have to face him twice in one battle, the second fight being much harder,
but you won't get to recover any of your health you spent during the first fight! Truly a challenge not for the 
weak of heart. If you fear this challenge, do not worry; all upcoming releases will have the option to 
to fight IBM or Normal Mode versions of the character. The Options.txt will show you how to change them.
- Added an IBM.txt in the readme's folder. This is similar to the command list, giving attack names and 
details on his abilities, accept they are his IBM abilities and the guide will also give you tips on how to
cope with each ability. It probably won't be enough to save you...
-----------------------------------------------------
ATTACKS:
- The launch attack of Freezing Tornado no longer needs to make contact in order for the whirlwind attack
to be used.
- Players now recieve (MINOR) guard damage from Freezing Tornado.

-----------------------------------------------------
SUMMONS:
- Minion Guide.txt has been updated to give information and strategy tips on Arthas's minions when they
are summoned while Arthas is in IBM, if they change while he is in that state.
-----------------------------------------------------
OHTER:
-Deleted some unused sounds.
-Added an Options.txt that will contain information on how to:
*Turn off his Music
*Turn off his Battle-Whispers
*Switch between fighting him in IBM and Normal modes
-Deleted a palette file I was using during his first creation, which was no longer needed.











Release 4 Updates
-----------------------------------------------------
BUG FIXES:
- Frost Fever is now refreshable, refer to Blood Plague note below.
- Blood Plague is now refreshable (the timer will reset if you hit an enemy with Plague Strike who already
has the Blood Plague).
- Voice and music sounds are louder, Arthas is easier to understand.
- Killing the enemy with the kick from the Spirit Breaker combo will no longer cause him to get back up 
from the ground and "trip" back down.
- Fixed an AI issue that caused Arthas to change his combo from Hope Crusher to Spirit Breaker if he was
hit during the first attack of the combo. Also reduced the likeliness of him choosing the Spirit Breaker 
combo over the Hope Crusher Combo.
- The Ice Spike from Iceshatter's damage now properly scales to the effect of Frost Fever
- Fixed the small mugshot by changing the image
- Remade the Large Ice Spike's collision boxes
- Remade the Geist's collision boxes (Getting hit and hitting enemy ranges have been fixed)
- Possibly fixed a issue that would cause the opponent to be stuck in position when hitting the
wall from the second attack of the Hope Crusher Combo
- (Hopefully) Fixed the Iceshatter issue that would cause Arthas to go underground if he was hit during a 
certain frame of the attack.
-----------------------------------------------------
ATTACKS:
- New Attacks have been added. Please refer to the information within the Command List.txt file in the
Read me's folder.

- Death Strike no longer removes diseases.
- Recreated the entire Death's Chill Ability. See Command List.txt for details.

----------------------------------------------------
