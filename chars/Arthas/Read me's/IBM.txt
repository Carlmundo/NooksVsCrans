INSANE BOSS MODE GUIDE

This little guide will help you understand all of IBM Arthas's abilities and statistics, and will help you 
overcome these abilities and help you survive while fighting Arthas.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IBM, WHAT IS IT?

Insane Boss Mode is a mode exclusive to the AI (meaning players can't access it) that gives Arthas 
incredible strength and new abilities, making him a much larger challenge to fight. Insane Boss Mode is 
triggered once you have "killed" Arthas in Normal Mode with his AI turned on. When it is triggered, he will
kneel to the ground, give a small speech, souls will swirl around him and he will regain all of his health, get
back up and the battle will resume. You will have to rethink your strategies for fighting him, because not 
only are his abilities much different, but he is also permanently in the status of Icebound Fortitude,
reducing the damage he takes in by half. Many will not find this challenge easy, if even possible. If you can
defeat him (and I don't mean with a character like Chuck Norris or Weegee -_-) consider it a Feat of 
Strength :)

ABILITIES:
Combos/Disease Moves
;;;

Plague Wave Combo *NEW*
Description: Arthas will attack with Frostmourne in 4 quick slashes, each slash unleashing a Plague Wave,
which contains a small sample of Blood Plague. Plague Waves will damage the enemy and refresh an
existing Blood Plague effect, but the sample is not strong enough to infect the enemy with Blood Plague if
he/she doesn't have it. In addition, the slashes also do damage and Arthas will slightly move forward with
each slash.
Strategy: The attacks as well as the Plague Waves are fast, and if you are far away the best option may be
to simply block the waves. If you are close, however, blocking both the waves and the attacks can prove 
painful, if you are close attempt to jump over Arthas, since he cannot turn while he is casting the Plague
Wave Combo

Hope Destroyer Combo *NEW*
Description: Arthas will unleash a fast 6 hit combo that will launch the enemy into the air, and then Arthas 
will jump into the air and finish with a flying kick
Strategy: The next attack of the combo can only be used if the previous attack makes contact, so try
to dodge any of the attacks by either moving back or jumping over Arthas. Blocking the attacks will not
do too much damage, either, and the flying kick will only be used if the final attack hits, so blocking
will not trigger it, making blocking a less effective but also good strategy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summons

Duo Ghoul Summon *NEW*
Description: Arthas will summon 2 ghouls at once, one of the far left of the screen and one at the far right.
Strategy: See Minion Guide.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ice Based

Improved Iceshatter *NEW*
Description: Similar to Iceshatter, Arthas will jump in the air and unleash Large Ice Spikes upon landing.
However, instead of one Large Ice Spike, Arthas will summon 4 Large Ice Spikes, one following the other
in a Chilling Path fashion. This attack deals Frost Damage.
Strategy: The Icespikes will cover a large area, so it is hard to be able to dodge them or get far behind 
enough to not be hit by them. The best strategy is to run through Arthas while he is in the air, so that you
can dodge all the Icespikes. Arthas will jump forward when you are far away, so this will slighty help you
get past him faster. If you fear that he is too far away to run past, then the best strategy, sadly, is to go far
back as you possibly can and hope to get hit by a minimal amount of Icespikes or hope that you are able
to get far enough to not get hit by them (which is unlikely).

Icebreaker *NEW*
Description: Arthas slides to the enemy with a chilling hand and grabs them, then with a mighty show of 
force slams them to the ground with the power of frost. The grab will also give the enemy Frost Fever (see
the command list.txt for information on Frost Fever). This attack deals Frost Damage.
Strategy: The grab can only be blocked while crouching and will miss if you are in the air, so if you see 
Arthas sliding over to you, either block it while crouching or jump and let the grab miss you.
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FINALE

When Arthas is at or below 25% health, he will cast his ultimate ability. This is less of an ability and more
of an additional phase in the fight. He will destroy the stage, and the battle will take place on a platform
floating high above the sky. The edge of the platform you are standing on extends with a bridge of ice, 
however if you step too far on that bridge, the ice will crumble and you will fall to your death. Meanwhile, 
Arthas will cast a series of attacks. These attacks will deal no damage to you but are designed to knock 
you closer to the edge of the ice. Arthas will raise Frostmourne into the sky and glow before executing an 
attack. The color of the glow will tell you what attack he will choose.



Green Glow - Hyperspeed Dash
Description: Arthas will appear at the far left of the screen and dash at high speeds towards you. Each
Dash will be faster than the last. When he gets close to you, he will strike and vanish, the strike will knock
you back. He will do this three times before he returns to the Attack Judging/Vulnerability state.
Strategy: Blocking the attacks will not push you back as far as getting hit but blocking is still dangerous.
The attacks will not hit you when you are jumping, so try to jump before Arthas hits you to dodge the attack.

Blue Glow - Air Slam
Description: Arthas will fly from the top of the screen to the bottom, and upon landing on the ground
execute a vertical slash that will knock you back from Arthas, and then he will vanish. The attack is 
unblockable. He will do this four times before he returns to the Attack Judging/Vulnerability state.
Strategy: As soon as Arthas vanishes, he will already be in the air, right next to where you are. The 
best strategy is to run under him each time he vanishes, and try not to accidentally run to your death. Be
careful though, this attack is NOT a good one to screw up on. If you get hit once, you will likely be unable
to recover in time to dodge the next attack.

Purple Glow - Summon Valkier
Description: Arthas will summon a Valkier that will assist him in pushing you off of the edge. A few seconds
after summoning her, Arthas will return to the Attack Judging/Vulnerability state. The Valkier will die after 
she takes in 500 damage, and can (currently) only cast one technique. She will vanish, and will dash 
towards you. If she touches you, it will knock you back. She will always be in the vertical position that
you are at the start of the flight. After she finishes an ability, she will be in an idle state for five seconds,
allowing you to attempt to kill her. She is invincible while she is attacking. Only 1 Valkier can be 
summoned at a time, and Arthas will not enter this attack state if one is already out.
Strategy: In order to dodge the flight, you need to time your jump correctly. Her flight will take place quite
a bit after she vanishes, almost like she is playing a trick on your mind that causes you to jump too early.
Try not to fall for it. It may sound easy, but the catch is that Arthas is still attacking while she is out, and
she will not vanish until she is killed. Also note that only her main body will hit you, don't let her big wings 
fool you. But in addition, only her main body can be hit.

Red Glow - Remorseless Winter
Descriprion : Arthas will summon 2 Frozen Orbs that will follow you and attempt to knock you off the edge.
Once the first 2 Orbs have vanished, he will summon two more Frozen Orbs. After THOSE two vanish, he
will return to the Attack Judging/Vulnerability state. The frozen orbs will vanish after a certain amount of 
time, or after they hit you. If the orbs are hit, they will freeze in their location for 1.5 seconds until chasing 
you again. While all of this is going on, he will also summon Frost Mines that will spawn in your location, 
and then explode. The explode graphic is larger than it's actual effect. Frost Mine explosions can also
hit Frozen Orbs.
Strategy : You have to keep moving, and it would help if your character is small and fast. You will need to
dodge the Frozen Orbs, but not stay in the same place for too long due to the Frost Mines. If you have a
character who can quickly spawn a ranged attack, you can attempt to use it to keep a Frozen Orb still
for a small period of time. Do NOT attack them with melee. If you are really good, you can use the Frost
Mines to your advantage, since their explosions will also hit the Frozen Orbs and cause their location to
freeze momentarily. It is not easy however, and really the best strategy is to pray that Arthas doesn't glow
red; you really don't want to come across this technique.



After going into the Attack Judging state 3 consecutive times, Arthas will go into the Vulnerability state.
Arthas is ALWAYS invincible until he is in the Vulnerability state, he will kneel to the ground and cease
attacking for a short period of time. This is your opportunity to finish him off. If you don't, he will return to
the Attack Judging state, regain invincibility, and repeat the process all over again.





Have Fun >:)
