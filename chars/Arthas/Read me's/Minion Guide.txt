RULING THE SCOURGE: FOR DUMMIES

In case you are unsure as to what this is, this is a little guide on all the minions and fiends that Arthas can
summon. Within this guide is information on each of you minions, the most efficient way to use them, and
strategies on how to get past them when you come face-to-face with them.

================================================================================
PART 1: YOUR GHOUL AND YOU

Ghouls love Arthas, I mean they LOVE Arthas, they even go as far as exploding themselves just to get 
some attention. Actually, the one thing they love more than Arthas IS exploding, so why not pull off a 
two-birds-one-stone? Ghouls will attempt to do 3 moves, running to the enemy and exploding, jumping to
the enemy and exploding, or just getting fire-happy and exploding spontaneously where they are 
summoned. Explosions caused by Ghouls cannot be blocked under normal means, and you can only 
summon 2 Ghouls at a time under normal means.

USES FOR YOUR GHOUL
Now, you may think that Ghouls are only useful for offensive. However, they can be used for defense as 
well! How is this you ask? Well, Ghouls ALSO explode when they are hit by an enemy. So two major uses
for Ghouls other than just to tell them to "sick'em" is
1. A projectile barrier. If the enemy has a projectile that dissipates after it hits something, the Ghoul could
get in the way of the projectile, providing you with an exploding sub-human shield.
2. Setting a Trap for the enemy. AI and first time players may not know that attacking a Ghoul means 
fireworks, and Ghoul Explosions are a good way to get a combo-happy melee enemy off of your back.

HOW TO GET RID OF GHOUL TROUBLE
Enemy Ghouls can put you at a major disadvantage, and you should know how to take care of them before
you dare to face off with Arthas.
Now, remember, Ghoul Explosions cannot be blocked, so standing in front of them is not a good option.
If you find yourself stuck in front of one, and have a projectile attack, you may be saved. Since Ghouls 
explode on enemy contact, a projectile can cause a premature explosion, ridding yourself of the Ghoul. 
However, you must remember that the blast radius is large, and you must be a good distance before 
preforming a ranged attack. 
Now, one thing you should know is that Ghouls have 2 weaknesses:
1. They aren't that smart, their brain has decayed some time ago, and their eyesight isn't too good either.
Ghouls aren't able to turn, so they will just face the direction Arthas faced when he summoned them, and
keep moving forward.
2. The journey from underground to the surface is a big'un, and it will take some time after Arthas begins
to summon them before they can do anything.
Knowing these weaknesses it's logical to assume that the best way around a Ghoul is to simply jump over
it. It takes a while to get out of the ground and it won't turn around so if you go behind the Ghoul, and keep
your distance (in case of spontaneous explosions) you should be fine.

IBM:
In Insane Boss Mode, Arthas summons two ghouls at once; one at the far left of the screen and one at the
far right. These ghouls will face eachother, and will run toward eachother, exploding when they meet. Be
warned that if one ghoul explodes, the other ghoul can continue to run until it hits something. The Normal
Mode ghoul weaknesses still remain, so the best option is to get behind one of them before they come
out of the ground, and allow them to collide into one another while you watch from afar.

================================================================================
PART 2: ON NOES! GEISTS!

If you call a dog, it will come directly to you. If you call a Geist, it will ask you to leave a message. Once a 
Geist is summoned, there is no way for Arthas to control it (some Lord of the Scourge he is). However, 
their inability to be controlled is their very best attribute. Only 3 Geists can be summoned under normal 
means, and a Geist will die after it takes 300 damage. Geists have 3 moves it will randomly choose:
1. Jump and Dash: The Geist will jump towards a wall, stick to it, then dash to an enemy, tackling them and
dealing damage.
2. Bonecrusher Combo: The Geist will run up to the enemy and attempt to preform a 3 hit combo. The 
combo only continues if the previoius attack made contact to the enemy
3. Launch and Gnaw: The Geist will attempt to launch the enemy into the air, then jump towards the enemy
and gnaw them upon landing. Gnaw is a grab where the Geist takes 3 chomps on the enemy. Grounded
enemies will not be grabbed by the Gnaw jump attempt.

A GEIST? WHAT DOES IT DO?

As stated before, Geists cannot be controlled. They will go off doing whatever they please. Also, you can 
only summon 3 Geists at a time (not including Army of the Dead). However, even though there is a limit,
Geists are still very useful. Their main use is that they are real troublemakers. Not only do they put out
damage, but they are jumping all over the place! Most enemies won't know exactly what to do when you
bring out the Geist Gang. You can summon Geists to put the enemy at a serious tight spot.

GEIST PESTICIDE

Geists are a very dangerous foe since they can distract you from the Big King himself, while dealing 
extra damage to you. The one real weakness of a Geist is that they become vulnerable when they are 
hit, preforming a dramatic recoil at even the smallest hits. Geists will die after they take 300 damage, so 
the best strategy is to hit them as fast as you can and prevent them from regaining control. Also note that
if you hit a Geist that is on the wall, it will fall of the wall and will become vulnerable when landing for a 
split second, this is the prefect opportunity to unleash massive hell upon the Geist

================================================================================
PART 3: LICHES

Well, you are the Lich King after all, and what is a Lich King if he can't summon Liches? Liches are not as 
active as the other minions, but they can be used for strategy to gain an advantage over your enemy. 
Liches have no offensive capabilities, but will assist and buff Arthas while they are alive. Liches will die 
once they take in 300 damage, and only 2 Liches can be summoned. The Lich has 2 abilities.
1. The first Lich that is up will cast Fortification of the Damned on Arthas. This will give him a shield that 
absorbs most of the damage Arthas takes. Fortification of the Damned lasts until the Lich who casted it is
killed.
2. The second Lich will cast Unholy Influence on Arthas. Unholy Influence is an attack boost that will cause
Arthas to deal 75% more damage on all attacks. Unholy Influence lasts until the Lich who casted it is killed.

USES FOR THE LICH
Well, it's obvious... They buff Arthas...

OWNING DA LICHES AND DA HOES
Getting rid of the Lich is a high priority before fighting Arthas since the buffs can be devastating, especially
when Fortification of the Damned is up. Liches will follow the screen so you can either attack them with a 
ranged ability or run towards them and pound them. The biggest issue with a Lich is fighting Arthas with AI
on and making him cast Death's Chill while Fortification of the Damned is up, you likely won't get enough 
time to kill Arthas. For this reason, it's best to leave Arthas untouched until you kill the Lich who is casting 
Fortification of the Damned.
