**Thank you everyone for the great feedback and bug reports**
Improvements:

  -Adjusted possibly all CLSN boxes for improved gameplay.

  -Changed input commands for all Special and Super moves (see ReadMe for details).
  -Pac-Man segment of Arcade Hyper is now the same for widescreen & fullscreen (Sorry, I had to do it).
  -Pong segment of Arcade Hyper now has a more proper intro.
  -Pong segment of Arcade Hyper is now controllable with Player / AI commands.
    ** This new behavior is optional, and can be reverted in the Config file
  -Bash n' Toss Throws (Light & Medium) are no longer blockable.
  -Disabled shadow on perfect win pose (looks better without it).
  -Censored burning corpse on Jailbarber Win Pose when blood option disabled in Config.
Bug Fixes:
