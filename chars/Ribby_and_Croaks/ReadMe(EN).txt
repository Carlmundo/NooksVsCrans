Explanation
===========

Ribby and Croaks are bosses in Cuphead. They are fought and encountered in the level Clip Joint Calamity on Inkwell Isle 1. 
Although they are usually separate during the fight, they share the same health bar. 
Croaks is a brown frog with a white belly. He wears a brown belt, brown boxing gloves and red pants/leggings. 
Ribby is a green frog who is shorter than Croaks, also having a white belly. He wears red boxing gloves, a red belt and white pants/leggings. 
Ever since their childhoods, Ribby and Croaks have been tough fighters that are always looking for a good fight. According to their second phase's death screen, 
they're from the wrong side of the lily pad, which is why they act crude and bad.
