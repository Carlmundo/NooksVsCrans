Eggmans Robots, for Winmugen (may also work in DOS)
By supermystery

Version 1
==========

Features most the Sonic 1 enemies

Known Bugs/Issues:
==================
Not all robots act like exactly how they did in the orginal game

Orbinaut will sometimes appear without the spikes orbiting it

sometimes the robots will appear out of nowhere if the character moves towards the area where the robots come out


================================================================
Rules and tips:
=================================================================

Gain points by attacking the robots each robot is worth 100 points, do it fast to get a high bonus at the end

For more of a challenge when you get close to where the robots come out they will change sides be sure to block any remaining enemies from behind

None of the enemies do any block damage so you can block as much as you like

Everytime you guard an attack or get hit by an attack you lose points the longer it takes for you to recover the points you will lose

Score ranks these depend on both your time bonus and you attack score:

Lowest: E
<= 500 points

Highest: Chaos Emerald
>= 1701 points
