So, The Crow Erick Draven my first work, and first realise.
This is my favorite character in the film world, and I really wanted to see it at Mugen.
but, in the end, I had to learn to work in FF and draw sprites.
The result you can see in this character
Firstly, I want to pay tribute to Brandon Lee
This role proved fatal for him. But at the same time, he has made him immortal.
This is a tragic death and it brought great sorrow to his family, mother Linda Lee Cadwell, sister Shannon Lee and bride Eliza Hutton. 
Brandon Lee a great actor and a great man worthy of his father Bruce Lee.  |
Rest in peace Brandon, and thank you!
So...
Here, now i wanna give Credits

- changed the MUGEN Command of "Hyper Pompgun" hyper move from "start" to "fdf_kk" in DCTemplate.cmd
- the original Taunt Statedef 195 now has its own animation (sprites #7070,0-2) in DCTemplate.air and basics.st

  also re-adjusted the "Hyper Pompgun" hyper move sprite x-positions of sprites #16500,0-41 in DCTemplate.sff,
