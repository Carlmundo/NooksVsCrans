WRECK-IT RALPH BREAKS THE BATTLEFIELD!

Wreck-It Ralph is a main protagonist of the 2012 film with the same name, and a 2018 sequel Ralph Breaks The Internet. He is a bad guy in the arcade game Fix-It Felix Jr. who's noticeable features are his huge hands and feet, made for wrecking things with ease. During the events of the movie, Ralph, not wanting to be the bad guy anymore, wants to leave his game by "game-jumping" in pursuit of a way to become a hero somewhere else by earning a medal in Hero's Duty. He also befriends Vanellope von Schweetz in Sugar Rush within the method.

Due to Ralph's massive size and tremendous weight, he's very robust and sturdy, as he will wreck anything and everything within the video game universe. For example, breaking a jawbreaker with his fists (to Vanellope 's suprise), and breaking each window within the Niceland apartment by merely jumping.
