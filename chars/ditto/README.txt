Hello! I'm DJ HannibalRoyce & I'm proud to introduce to you my lastest creation, DITTO!

Ditto is a genderless pokemon with the ability to transform into anything it sees, as well as its abilities. He can also transform based off its memory, but doing so doesn't give it accurate transformations.  

In MUGEN, Ditto transforms into many pokemon in order to attack, which makes his gameplay VERY unusual & unique. Since it's based off memory, his size proportions may be a little off...especially Tyranitar. (lol)

Thank You for downloading Ditto...you won't be disappointed.
Remember to spread the word & make those youtube vids!!!
