COMMAND LIST
===================================

-------------
Specials:
-------------

Telepathic Attack - The name kind of says it all. The strength of the punch button dictates how far the attack reaches. Using the strong/fierce punch will cause the opponent to go into a dizzy state if hit.
D, DF, F + P

Wheel Chair Dash - His wheel chair is not just useful for getting around. When pushed to its limit, it can make for a good battering ram.
D, DF, F + K

Astral Mode - Common among telepathics is the ability to project images of themselves. This timed attack lets you fly around and attack your opponent from a far distance. Watch out, though, if you take three hits, and your astral projection will go away.
D, DB, B + P

-------------
Hypers:
-------------

Cerebro Fury - Cerebro is a device that increases Xavier's powers, allowing his to unleash a powerful telepathic attack.
D, DF, F + 2P

Welcome to the Astral Plane - This is very similar to his Astral Mode special, except your opponent cannot reach Xavier or hit him.
D, DB, B + 2P

Wheel Chair Barrage - This is a fun chain hyper, similar to his wheel chair dash. Rapidly hit one of the three punch buttons to continue the hyper in the air.
D, DF, F + 2K

Astra Armor Hyper - Xavier will generate an astral form of himself in a special armor and attack his enemy.
D, DB, B + 2K

X-Men Attack! - A blast from the past, Xavier's classic original X-Men come back in some nostalgic costumes to aid Xavier in defeating his opponent.
D, DB, B + P and K
