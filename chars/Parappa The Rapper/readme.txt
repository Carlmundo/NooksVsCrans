With the ONLY parappa in MUGEN by an unknown person
The only goods are the sprites and Sounds It lacks Hypers OR Specials
Therefore and so
Heres This Parappa I did
It uses the Sprites of the Unknown creator's and uses kungfuman as Its base
Aside from a few things 
Version: Beta 0.5


Specials
===========
D,DF,F X (Punch Punch Punch) Basicly Multi Punching
IF you do the command D,DF,F X again during this Multi Punching special 
You will do a Chop

D,DF,F Y (Mic Stretch) Based off of one of the Playstation all stars battle royal game
where parappa uses some attacks (Which is based on the move)
If you are far you get hit back
if you are too close you can get a knockback and fall

Hypers
================
D,DF,F,D,DF,F,x (Kick Punch Its all in the mind) A simple hyper looking combo
