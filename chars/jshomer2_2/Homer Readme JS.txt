=====================
JS Homer Simpson v2.2
August 8, 2007
=====================

Warner has given me permission do release my own version of his Homero. This is the full English Homer Simpson MUGEN character with numerous balance changes and added combo friendliness. This character is probably the biggest collaboration MUGEN creation to date, with a total of six people having worked on Homer at one time or another!

I've also fixed the most glaring glitch with Homer for the longest time: the Level 1 Cherry Bombs healing opponents when you attack them while they are stunned.

Homer's gameplay has been revamped. It is now based on King of Fighters XI's gameplay. This means Homer now has Super Cancels and even Dream Cancels. Homer also has EX Specials (from CvS). Overall, Homer keeps his original Iori Yagami roots, but now his gameplay is a looser KOF-style.

==============
Major Changes:
==============

These are the major changes from Warner's original Homero J. Simpson to JS Homer Simpson, introduced in its initial v1.0 release:

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

IMPORTANT! READ THIS CAREFULLY!!!!!

As of v1.1, the folder and .DEF file renamed to "jshomer".

You have to edit your SELECT.DEF file to reflect this change!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

*Homer has added combo ability. The second hit of his three-hit rush can now cancel into any Special (except Kinetic Donut) or Super move (except Hell Candy Bomb).
*New normal intro animation: Based on his "new life" animation from the Simpsons Arcade game (caped Homer).
*Homer's classic Peter Kick intro is now a custom intro against Peter Griffin (with extra coding by BBHood217).
*New custom intro aganst CHOUJIN's DBZ characters (by GigaBowserX).
*Two new victory animations. Now, you can choose what victory animation you want (see below).
*Homer no longer has invincibility frames outside his crawling dodge. The age of invincibility abuse by spamming Bart Slingshots is now over.
*BBHood217: Fixed broken Level 2 Bash Dash Masher for both normal and Beer Riot mode.
*BBHood217: Most attack frames are no longer invincible.
*Bart Slingshot -> Kinetic Donut: Homer now has a faster projectile attack with no more invincibility frames.
*Cherry Bombs -> Hell Candy Bomb: Graphical facelift for parody of Iori's flame pillar attack. Again no invincibility except for brief NotHitBy sctrl on SuperPause. Also, enemies stunned in mid-air fall to the ground and play their dizzy animations while stunned.
*Several new sounds.


=========
Movelist:
=========

Homer's moveset is completely based on that of Iori Yagami from the King of Fighters series by SNK. If you know how to play as Iori, you can pick up Homer very quickly.

NOTES: QCF = Quarter Circle Forward (D, DF, F), QCB = Quarter Circle Back. HCF = Half Circle Forward (B, D, F), HCB = Half Circle Back

a = Weak kick
b = Strong kick
x = Weak punch
y = Strong punch

Power Charge: c OR b+y
Crawling Dodge: z
Taunt: Start

Specials:
Unless otherwise stated, all Specials and EX Specials can be performed in Beer Riot mode as well.

Kinetic Donut (QCF + P): Homer using donuts as projectiles? Only if they are charged with kinetic energy...and made of spinach.
    *WARNING: Homer is no longer invincible doing this move!
Homer 3-hit Rushdown (QCB + P (up to 3x)): ARGH! D'OH! WOOHOO! This seemingly pedestrian attack rush is a staple in Homer's fighting repetoire.
    *The second hit can be canceled into any move below (except, of course, the Beer Riot Homer activation).
Woohoo Whirlwind (F, D, DF + P): Homer jumps with arms and legs outstretched to pound opponents into the air. This is Homer's anti-air move and he is invincible during its startup.
    *The weak version does one hit. The strong version does three hits.
Rush Tackle Kick (HCB + K): Homer rushes towards his opponent in a blind rage and tries to tackle him/her to the ground. If the tackle is successful, Homer will kick the opponent away. 
Sideswitch (HCB, F + P): Homer grabs his opponent and slides them to the other side. This confuses the opponent as now his/her back is now turned to Homer and is now under the mercy of attacks. This move is disabled in Beer Riot Mode.

BEER RIOT HOMER (HCB + Start): Homer takes in a life-threatening amount of Duff Beer to increase his speed, attack power, and fighting prowess. Homer even gains several new Supers in this mode! Homer's drunken hallucinations become a reality to his opponent, as Homer morphs into different forms as he attacks. This move is very risky because it cuts whatever health he has left by one half!
    *NOTE: Homer has Dream Cancels only in Beer Riot mode!

EX Specials:
All EX Specials have similar joystick motions to their regular versions. All of them use up half a bar of Super energy.

EX Kinetic Donut (QCF, x+y): Homer throws a super-charged Kinetic Donut at his opponents, dealing multiple hits.
EX Woohoo Whirlwind (F, D, DF, x+y): This very strong Woohoo Whirlwind does five hits. It cannot be Super Canceled out of.

Supers:
NOTE: For Supers with three levels: Lv1 = Weak, Lv2 = Strong, Lv3 = Weak+Strong.

Bash Dash Masher (QCF, HCB + P): Homer suddenly goes insane and starts pummeling his opponent into a pulp.
    *Level 1: Bite finisher.
    *Level 2: Tackle kick finisher.
    *Level 3: Butt slam finisher.
    *Can be Super Canceled into. 
Hell Candy Bomb (QCB, HCF + P): Homer tosses an improvised grenade made from a can of soda and a bag of Pop Rocks. Enemies hit by the grenade or caught in the explosion will be stunned for a few seconds.
    *==NORMAL MODE ONLY==
    *Level 1: 2 explosions, 40 damage.
    *Level 2: 4 explosions, 80 damage.
    *Level 3: 8 explosions, 160 damage.
Ready Aim Fire: (QCFx2 + y): Homer pulls out a powerful Desert Eagle handgun and pops a cap into his opponent, who is sent flying in an unrecoverable fall. Deals 275 damage.
    *==NORMAL MODE ONLY==
    *NO VISIBLE PROJECTILE: Infinite velocity.
    *Requires 2 bars of energy.
    *Can be Super Canceled into.
Drunken Tornado (QCFx2 + P): Homer's drunken brawling specialty, he makes multiple jumps with arms outstretched and spinning wildly, hitting his opponent multiple times. (Compare to Shouryuu-Reppa).
    *==BEER RIOT MODE ONLY!==
    *Three levels, each more powerful than the last.
Touch of Death (QCF, HCB + z): Homer calls upon the power of the Grim Reaper to attack his opponent with a touch from his bony hand. Homer is invincible while performing this move, but he is also immobile; executing this Super far away from an opponent will be a complete waste.
    *==BEER RIOT MODE ONLY!==
    *Requires 2 bars of energy.
    *Can be Dream Canceled into.
Road Roller D'oh! (QCF, HCB + b): Where the hell does Homer get a steamroller from? Be very careful when using this move. If the move misses, it will fail, leaving Homer wide open for a counterattack.
    *==BEER RIOT MODE ONLY!==
    *Requires 3 bars of energy.
    *Can be Dream Canceled into.
    *WARNING: This move is blockable!
    *WRYYYYYY!!!
Shun Homer Satsu (x, x, F, a, y): Also called the Raging Donut, Homer calls upon the dark power of the Forbidden Donut to deal deadly blows to his opponents.
    *==BEER RIOT MODE ONLY!==
    *Requires 4 full bars of super energy.
    *Cannot be blocked by opponents.
    *Cannot be comboed into.
    *This is a pure hit-or-miss attack. Use it wisely.

Choose your victory animation! Hold down the corresponding button just as you KO your opponent:

a = Evil Homer
b = I am so S-M-R-T!
c = Iori Invincible
x = Bart Tease
y = Homer Spin

Homer also has a set of victory animations in Beer Riot mode:
a or b = "To alcohol: the cause of and solution to all of life's problems."
c or x = "Free Duff! Viva life!"
y      = Flander-ality

======
F.A.Q.
======

Please read this before sending me questions about Homer's moves and so on.

Q. Why is Homer based on Iori?
A. This is the story from Warner himself: He made an animated GIF a long time ago of Homer in Iori's clothing. He received H"'s permission to use his CvS Iori Yagami MUGEN character as a basis for Homeriori. Originally, this was going to be a MUGEN character of Homer in Iori's clothing. However, Warner noticed that there were no normal Homer Simpson MUGEN characters available for MUGEN at the time, so he decided to use Iori as a basis, but use Homer in his normal clothing. There are several Homer Iori sprites that went unused for a long time until I implemented them in a custom intro for a video I made a while ago.

Q. How do I change the AI?
A. Edit HOMER.DEF in a text editor. Comment out this line:

cmd     =homer-brutalAI.cmd

And uncomment this line:

;cmd     =homer-noAI.cmd ; Uncomment this is you want a very stupid Homer. :D


Q. How do you do Super Cancels?
A. Right now, Homer can only Super Cancel from the Strong Woohoo Whirlwind (the five-hit one). To Super Cancel, perform any of the Supers listed above as Super Cancelable during the FIRST TWO HITS of the Woohoo Whirlwind.

Q. How do you do Dream Cancels?
A. First, you have to be in Beer Riot mode, as Homer can only Dream Cancel in that mode. Next, Homer can Dream Cancel only during the first attack rush of any of his Bash Dash Mashers. Perform the Super you want to Dream Cancel into during this attack rush (of course you have to have the requisite energy to do those Supers).

Q. Homer's moves are too hard!
A. Practice makes perfect. Homer's a King of Fighters character, and that game's gameplay stresses strategic use of moves over 80-hit combos.

Q. A steamroller? Why?
A. It's a direct reference to a move by Dio Brando called "Road Roller Da!" from a game called Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. Dio does the same thing, steamroller and all, with the same victory scream (the infamous "WRYYYYYY!"). This move is popular in Japanese culture and an internet meme, but is extremely obscure to those in the Western Hemisphere. That's why it's a blatantly obvious reference.

Q. Why don't you change it into a Duff Truck or Mr. Plow?
A. Because this is MUGEN, not the Simpsons show. Homer can have any move that he wants, and not all of them have to be direct references to the show.

Q. But, it's not from the show!
A. So? It's called creative liberties. This is a Homer fighting game character, not the actual show. And this being a fighting game, Homer in MUGEN has references and parodies of other fighting game moves, just as The Simpsons show parodies movies and other TV shows.

Q. But...
A. (ignored)

Q. Are you considering adding new moves?
A. As soon as I resolve all current issues, I may consider adding more moves. Specifically, I will add more moves similar to Iori's remaining moves not parodied by Homer.

- AESTHETIC FIX: Iori win animation edited to match voice clip.
- AESTHETIC FIX: Some palettes fixed.

v2.1 (August 6, 2007)

- FIXED: Road Roller D'oh! glitch in Training Mode when about to finish the move on an opponent with 1 HP left.
- BALANCE FIX: Shrank CLSN1 box on Homer's Shun Homer Satsu gliding animation. It was almost impossible to jump over this attack (the only way to evade it as it is unblockable) with the oversized CLSN1 box before.
- BALANCE FIX: Bash Dash Mashers for both modes: much longer recovery lag if the move is blocked or misses. This fix prevents the AI from performing tick throws on players. It is now also easier to punish Homer players if they continually spam the Bash Dash Mashers.

- FIXED: Thanks to BBHood217's help, the Road Roller D'oh! and the Shun Homer Satsu now work perfectly in Team matches!

- CHANGED: Quote: "D'oh! It just gets worse and worse!" to "Awww crap!"
- BALANCE FIX: Strong Woohoo Whirlwind reduced from 5 hits to 3 hits. This is to offset the EX Woohoo Whirlwind, which still does 5 hits.
- BALANCE FIX: Shun Homer Satsu: Glide speed reduced, leftover AfterImage removed if move fails, Glide time reduced from 200 ticks to 30 ticks. This means Homer can no longer do this move to opponents on the other side of the screen.
- BALANCE FIX: Made Beer Riot's Mr. Burns Head toss do more damage to offset its longer start-up lag when compared to the Kinetic Donut.
