;-| Homer's AI |---------------------------------------------------
; Note to kingshadow3:
;    I had to change the AI trigger variable number from 24 to 7. It was
;    conflicting with a variable 24 already being used in a common state,
;    which causes the Power Charge move to be disabled. Base your future
;    AI updates on this .CMD file. Thanks!
