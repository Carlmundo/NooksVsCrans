Explanation
===========

The Root Pack are one of the first bosses fought in Cuphead. 
They are the simplest bosses in the game to fight and are usually the first boss the player will fight in Inkwell Isle One. 
Moe Tato is a large potato, Weepy is an onion with a rather large purple nose, and Psycarrot is a large carrot with forehead creases that hide his third eye. 
Moe Tato's personality is unknown overall but seems to like stuffing dirt and worms into his mouth, based on his only attack. Based on his facial expressions, he could be grumpy at all times. 
Weepy can be very sad and socially awkward and seems to have pantophobia (the fear of everything). 
Psycarrot is very skilled in psychic abilities, as proven by one of his two attacks, and seems to be very maniacal and crazy. When he pops out of the ground, he makes a boasting gesture at the players, suggesting that he is a show-off. He is also the presumed leader of the group.
