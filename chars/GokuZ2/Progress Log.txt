ALPHA 1 :
- Changed files and names to get my personal layout.
- Modified constants and files to get back Winmugen compatibility.
- Redoing animations in .AIR because I don't like what Kratos did.
- Realigned the sprites.
- Scrapped all the code and used my Batman as a base.
- Added most of the gethits. I still have to add the twist in the air, but it's an optional anim. Will be done in due time.
- All basics are done, which means 3 punches and 3 kicks for stance/crouch/air types. I haven't done the "command moves" yet, ie moves that didn't fit these basics but will be useful : cartwheel kick, knee kick, snap kick, slash chop, etc.
- Basically, the same combo system as Batman was implemented : combo heavy character, chaining from light to medium to hard, with any combination of punch and kick, as long as you stay in the same position (stance, air or crouch). The uppercut which serves as launcher is done with DF+z.
This means combos such as :
       - s.LP, s.MP, Uppercut, jump, a.LP, a.MP, a.SP   if you use only punches for example.
       - s.LP, s.MK, Uppercut, jump, a.LK, a.MP, a.SK   if you mix punches and kicks, since you can use any combination as long as it follows the light-medium-strong order.
       - c.LK, c.MP, Uppercut, jump, a.LK, a.MK, a.SP   if you start crouching for example.
- Running, run stop, super jump, etc. were recoded.
- Coded power charge (base from Ryu). Missing the FX and sounds
- Coded aerial dash.
- Added victory pose.
- Coded all variations of Ki Blast.

- Coded Slash Down Kick.
- Recoded Ki Blast follow ups to make them smoother.
- Coded Dragon Fist.

ALPHA 2 :
- Using jab for long range s.LP and backhand for close s.LP.
- s.HK doesn't go as far now.
- a.MK now allows cross-up.
- Left Hook Punch is used for a MP combo, such as : MP (gut punch), MP (left hook punch). This also allows s.LP>s.MP>s.MP>s.HP for example.
- Fixed victory pose. Last frame was the bad one. 
- The 3rd attack of his Dragon Fist launches the enemy a tad farther up, so Goku at least lands on the ground before the opponent does.
- Fixed the Dragon Uppercut timings (end of rising, and spinning speed).
- His Knee Kick is used as Close-range standing MK, and can be chained into Left Hook Punch, allowing for s.LK>s.MK>s.MP>s.HP for example.
- Cartwheel kick added, performed with F,F+c.
- Removed s.SP > s.SK combo.
- Changed the dampener to MVC style.

ALPHA 4 :

- Dragon Kick sends the opponent much further now.
- Changed back dash behaviour : you have to maintain Back after a first back dash to go in flik flak state.

- New big portrait.
- Changed Air Dash behaviour.
- Fixed problem with reversed a.HK.

- Added extra frame for Slashdown Kick.
- a.MKx3's combo. 2nd+3rd kick = single MK button. Comboing the 2nd kick is kinda easy, but you need to be placed well for the 3rd one,in order to combo after into SP/SK.
- Made his eye darkbrown on his small portrait.
- New close LP (new anim).
- EX Snap Kick (Scissor Wheel Kick) : unblockable attack that sends the opponent flying. Doesn't deal much damage, but great against turtlers.
- Hurricane Kick (+ FX), all 3 versions with various vels and damage. Didn't add the feature to do more hits as Balthazar suggested. He'll test and see if he likes it. :P

- Remade the collision boxes : removed blue CLSNs under knees on aerial sprites. Remade all red CLSNs to give more priority to attacks when needed. I'll probably be changing over and over again ... Also, CLSNs for aerial basics are bigger, to ease the combos.

- Cartwheel Kick is now an overhead (completely forgot it was supposed to act this way ...).
- You can now chain Cartwheel Kick into (EX) Dragon Fist and (EX) Hurricane Kick.

- New close s.MK (Knee Kick) animation.

- a.SP delas more damage now, to balance it a bit with a.SK which can be combo'd from.
- Changed launcher command to D+z instead of DF+z. In short, removed his normal c.SP basic (which almost had the same animation as s.SP anyway) and replaced it by the launcher.
- Added sounds (woosh SFX + voice) to his "lift arm" victory pose.
- Added "Ike" voice to the intro.
- Slightly changed intro timings.
- Finally, didn't change his run stop sound, but added sliding to state 101. Feels more natural now IMO.

New update after HDBZ Release :
- Louder beam sound (2480,0)
- Startup on throws reduced to 4 ticks, and recovery time set up to 18 ticks.
- Super DBZ super BG doesn't display any lifebars anymore.

- Longer startup for Ex Snap Kick, and modified guard.pausetime for whole rekkas, making the move less safe on block.
- Genkidama Lv3 is played correctly (didn't I fix that before ?)
- Added charging/power-up sound that gets more intense over time to Chou Kmh (2400,20).

HDBZ 2 (sent 08/07) :
- New Chou Kamehameha animation.
- s.MK (far) > s.MP combo is now possible (it could only be performed from close s.MK before).
- Kaioken finisher is chosen by the button you use to perform the command (A=Fullscreen Hyper Kick, B=Rising + Hurricane Kick, C=Nappa Finisher). However, you can still choose which one to use by holding buttons just like before.
- Made Emo mode startup (aka Genkidama startup command) as D,D,D+y+b.
- Changed the pause parameters during Bicycle Kick and powered-up variations, so they aren't zero frame anymore (i.e. if you're not already blocking before the super flash, you will take the hit).
- Changed varsets in order to avoid this type of stuff : Air to air loop : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLULc5HAkng (spin kick variants are all just one state and it reads which command you used to decide the vels, hitdefs and whatnot. The problem is that the move is constantly reading the button inputs so you can, for example, start a L variant of the spin kick and then press M or H kick a few frames later and affect how the hitdefs are going to act like.)
- Can't airguard anymore if jumping forward or if you have air dashed (fix by Websta in Freeza).
- Longer recovery time for Chou Kamehameha, to avoid comboing into s.LK/s.LP.

- Finally added this long due 100 winquotes, 71 of them being character specific, with over 1500 compatible characters!
- Changed whoosh sound effect for his reverse throw to be the Strong Punch woosh sound. Changed forward throw sound too, because it makes no sense to have different woosh sounds for both throws.
- Changed impact sound for his forward throw (the jumping headbutt) to be the 'PING!' impact sound (s5,9).
??? GENKIDAMA SOUNDS ???
- Nerfed Ki Blasts :
	+ Decreased push back by almost half
	+ Added recovery time to 2nd and 3rd ki blast (at least 10 ticks).
- Revamped the way Kaioken Finishers end so that they're in line with other Z2 characters, and changed damage accordingly (Genkidama Kaioken Finisher deals less damage now) :
	+ Level 0 (outside of Hope Mode) : 1st Person Kick/Hyper Kick Finisher - 383 damage.
	+ Level 1 (Hope Gauge <50%) : Rising Typhoon Kick Finisher - 447 damage.
	+ Level 2 (Hope Gauge >50%) : Teleport Attack and Backbreaker Finisher - 530 damage.
	+ Level 3 (Hope Gauge MAX) : Genki Dama Finisher - 633 damage.

==================================================================================================
TODO :
- Try using opponent's FX for slash chop.


WUT WUT :
? He still is able to do one that's 1141 damage (with Full 'Genki-Dama' and full super meter) 'Slash Down Kick', LP, MP, MP, HK, EX 'Dragon Fist', 'Turn Elbow Smash', 'Dragon Blast Uppercut', EX 'Dragon Kick', MP, MP, MK 'Hurricane Kick', 'Meteor Attack', MP, MP, MK 'Hurricane Kick', Full Charge 'Genki-Dama', charge while opponent's dizzy, HK, Dragon Fist', 'Turn Elbow Smash', 'Dragon Blast Uppercut', 'Meteor Attack', 'Bicycle Kick', 'Slash Down Kick'.
? I was able to replicate the screen dimming against Hercule, and it seems that the common denominator is Chou Kamehameha.  If you get the Chichi intro and you finish the second round with C. Kamehameha then the screen will dim during the winpose.
? I also came across something else but I'm not sure how to get it to happen again. I pressed F1 (Team arcade, Goku and Hercule vs Hercule) and another Hercule appeared behind Goku for a second (a playable Hercule, not a BG one.) so there was the Hercule I was fighting, my teammate in the bg, and a playable Hercule behind me, just for a second though.
? Kaiyoken (Kicks combo) sometimes freezes the opponent in mid screen and causes them to float off screen : Against all characters. This was tested in training mode against characters varying from you Cybaster along with Jmorphman, POTS, Kamekaze, SeanAlty, etc.
- When not full, the Hope Gauge can be covered by foreground objects.
- Statetype problem (not fixed yet) : flik flak, cartwheel kick (Changing the physics from A to N and adapting the code afterwards may solve the problem.)
- Just for fun, I tried to kill a 100% life Goku with a Forbidden GenkiDama : Slashdown Kick, MK, MP, Crouching HP, Jumping HK, HK, Strong Hurricane Kick, Kaioken, Forbidden GenkiDama. You guys will be able to do it anywhere in the screen, and the combo becomes an intermediate challenge that causes 100%.
? If you stand on the far side of the screen, shoot three ki blasts, and use Lv 2 or Lv 3 Meteor Kick then the last ki blast will shoot the opponent out of the kick, with Goku continuing the move without the opponent.


FEEDBACK :

??? New Chou Kame charge loop sprites! You can use the mouth from SSJ Goku.

- Another Goku's winpose where he says "Wakuwaku suruzo" which is his trademark "this is exciting" line is ok, but not as a winpose, more like intro before the battle.
>>> Yeah use the new Genkidama fx I suppose.


MUGEN 1.0 STUFF !!!
- Update all stuff : HitDefs ???
- Change position of explods based on resolution.

? I was able to perform j.MK > Slashdown kick on Goku himself (tested in Mugen 1.0) normally like against Hulk and KFM though I didn't get it recorded but now the combo is unable to be pulled off.

NEW STUFF TO ADD BY CYBASTER !!!
- the inclusion of the properly-colored select screen version of the small portrait
- Please add a chain for c.SP > EX Hurricane Kick :)
- The Ki Blast impact sound is too loud when it comes to those fast rapid-fire hits beam attacks, they get really annoyingly loud, so please add a seperate sound effect entry for all his other energy attacks (like Kamehameha and Genki Dama), besides his regular Ki Blast using this sound effect: (to be included)
- Can we also change the impact sound effects of his Kamehameha's into those of Vegeta's Galick Ho? Those are a bit softer (it can get really noisy when those very rapid hits rack up, so a softer sound effect for those quick impact hits will help I think).
- This is more a personal nitpick but I've come to hate his 'deal with it' sunglasses falling Perfect Winpose, I'd like to have that removed
- Many animations to update !!!!!

- I think we might need to nerf the QCF+P Ki Blasts : Perhaps have it give a little less supermeter as well, especially on hit.

- Alright Goku really needs some additional recovery ticks on most of his attacks like his Hurricane Kick and Dive Kick, he's just too safe on block with most things. He's so annoying to fight against. We'll have to discuss these a bit more. The Dragon Fist moves (moreso the first attack) are way too safe on block.
