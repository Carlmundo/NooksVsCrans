=Added Kaioken aura to Kaioken Super Kamehameha (upwards).
=Super Kamehameha explods movement during pause/superpause fixed.

=Revamped the way Kaioken Finishers end so that they're in line with other Z2 characters, 
 and changed damage accordingly (Spirit Bomb Kaioken Finisher deals less damage now):
=Level 0 (outside of Hope Mode) : 1st Person Kick/Hyper Kick Finisher - 383 damage.
=Level 1 (Hope Gauge <50%) : Rising Typhoon Kick Finisher - 447 damage.
=Level 2 (Hope Gauge >50%) : Teleport Attack and Backbreaker Finisher - 530 damage.
=Level 3 (Hope Gauge MAX) : Spirit Bomb Finisher - 633 damage.

=Added simplefied command for Hope Mode activation: d, d+MK+MP.

=Getting hit while in Hope Mode does not drain the Hope Bar anymore.
=If you lose the round with Hope Mode active, the Mode is cancelled when you start the next round.

=Hope Mode Activation > Spirit Bomb (during the superpause) is now possible.
=Command for Spirit Bomb is d,d+MP+MK.

=Instead of explods, now the helpers use the sparkno in their hitdefs. This means that, although the hitsparks can't be
 scaled like before, there won't be problems regarding hitspark positioning (eg against Piccolo's clones).

=Intro sounds will now stop if the intro is skipped.
=Shenron intro fixed (BG Pal FX, sound effects etc.).
